Latent Diffusion Models:
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by gradually transforming noise into a data distribution. They can be used for various tasks, including image generation and editing.

Virtual Try-on Systems:
Virtual try-on systems typically involve fitting clothes onto a user's image. They require accurate body segmentation, pose estimation, and cloth deformation techniques to make the try-on look realistic.

We tried to enhance this model according to our problem solution- a virtual try on based chatbot tested on Indian models for better inclusivity for the Indian fashion market.
